# AI Interaction Log: Project Proposal Development

**AI Assistant:** Google Gemini
**Date:** October 6, 2025

This log documents the iterative process of developing the "JobWise" project proposal. The interaction involved brainstorming, refining concepts, drafting, and revising based on user feedback and assignment requirements.

### **Interaction 1: Initial Brainstorming & Feasibility**

**User Prompt:**
> "I need some idea for this. im doing mobile dev. I had an ai travel buddy app that would recommend place of interests based on location and user preferences (based on a personality quiz). Another idea is a resume builder and tailored for job description. The app would scout jobs based and tailored my resume by ai and automactically send applications and cover letters. Does the resume app big enough for the scope?"

**AI Reply:**
> (Abridged) "Excellent ideas! Both projects have strong potential... To answer your question directly: The full vision is likely too large for a 7-week solo project... However, you can scope it down to a fantastic and achievable project... Go with the AI Resume Assistant but be very strict about the scope. In your proposal, explicitly state that automated application submission is a 'non-goal'..."

**Summary of Action:**
> The AI analyzed two user-provided project ideas against the detailed assignment rubric. It provided a breakdown of each idea's strengths and weaknesses regarding multi-agent design, mobile track fit, and feasibility. The AI recommended the resume app but advised that the scope needed to be reduced to be feasible for a solo 7-week project.

### **Interaction 2: Refining the Core Concept**

**User Prompt:**
> "my main goal for the resume app is to quickly scout jobs and have tailored resume. I imagine kinda like dating apps interaction like swipe left and right for a jobs. Maybe just save and apply later with a reminder and tailored resume and cover letter is the main goal here"

**AI Reply:**
> (Abridged) "That's an excellent refinement. The 'dating app' interaction model is a brilliant way to frame this project for the Mobile Development Track... Let's structure this refined idea to fit directly into your project proposal... System Coordination Pattern: Event-Driven Pipeline. The user's 'swipe right' action is the event that triggers a pipeline of agent activity..."

**Summary of Action:**
> The AI refined the project concept based on the user's "dating app for jobs" metaphor. It updated the Executive Summary, Technical Architecture, and Project Management sections of the proposal to incorporate this user-centric interaction model, which strengthened the project's mobile track justification.

### **Interaction 3: Clarifying Assignment Requirements**

**User Prompt:**
> "multi-agent is for development not app integration."

**AI Reply:**
> (Abridged) "You've hit on a critical point... The course requires you to think about multi-agent systems in two distinct contexts: 1. The Development Process... 2. The Application Architecture... Based on the assignment requirements, you must do both... The prompt specifies that the application you design must be a multi-agent system. Here is the evidence from the `README.md` file: Part 2: Technical Architecture & Multi-Agent Design..."

**Summary of Action:**
> The AI addressed a user misunderstanding of the assignment requirements. It clarified that the assignment requires both a multi-agent development *process* and a multi-agent application *architecture*, citing specific sections of the provided instructions to guide the user correctly.

---
### **Interaction 4: Drafting the Proposal**

**User Prompt:**
> "give me draft of my proposal. leave place holders for app design and multi agent work flow. Your main is to draft the summary and non-technical part of the proposal. Follow closedly the outline of the instructions"

**AI Reply:**
> (Abridged) "Of course. Here is a draft of the non-technical sections for your `project-proposal.md`. It follows the structure from the assignment instructions and incorporates the 'JobSwipe AI' concept we discussed..."

**Summary of Action:**
> The AI drafted the non-technical portions (Parts 1, 3, and 4) of the `project-proposal.md` file. It followed the assignment's structure, incorporated the project concept, and created placeholders for the technical sections for the user to complete.

### **Interaction 5: Iterating on the Project Name**

**User Prompts (Multiple):**
> "i dont like this name give me more naming ideas"
> "more"
> "more 2 syllable name"
> "2 - 3 syllable words"
> "more something job and career related"
> "more"

**AI Replies:**
> (Series of replies providing categorized lists of names based on the evolving constraints.)

**Summary of Action:**
> The AI engaged in an iterative brainstorming process to find a suitable project name. It generated multiple lists of names, progressively refining the options based on user feedback and constraints such as syllable count and thematic relevance. The final interaction in this series pivoted to a decision-making framework to help the user select a name from the generated options.

### **Interaction 6: Finalizing the Name and Proposal Content**

**User Prompt:**
> "go with jobwise"

**AI Reply:**
> (Abridged) "Excellent choice. 'JobWise' is a strong, professional name that clearly communicates intelligence and purpose. Here is the final draft of your non-technical proposal sections, updated with the name **JobWise**."

**Summary of Action:**
> The AI confirmed the user's final name selection ("JobWise"). It updated the entire non-technical proposal draft with the new name and provided the complete text.

---
### **Interaction 7: Revising and Formatting the Final Proposal**

**User Prompts (Multiple):**
> "add placeholder for other sections. make it a complete proposal..."
> "I dont think i would have a multi-agent backend for the app. Just 1 AI..."
> "do not over exaggerate the technology... Dont bluff, and dont yap"
> "i dont like mobile-first... focus on convenience."
> "fix the 'track specialization indentification'..."
> "give me in md format with correct header format"
> "stop using canvas and give an actual .md file"

**AI Replies:**
> (Series of replies providing complete, updated versions of the `project-proposal.md` file in the requested format, incorporating the user's feedback at each step.)

**Summary of Action:**
> The AI performed a series of revisions on the complete proposal draft based on specific user requests. This included:
> * Adding detailed placeholders for all technical sections.
> * Clarifying the multi-agent architecture to better align with the user's vision while still meeting assignment requirements.
> * Revising the tone to be more professional and direct.
> * Reframing the mobile track justification to focus on "convenience."
> * Making several formatting adjustments to produce a clean, final Markdown file ready for submission.
