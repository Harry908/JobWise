# General Interaction Log

## Log Entry: 5

### User Request

fix my chat modes so they add log entry numbering when they create log. the number should be increment from the lastest one in the log files

### Response Summary

I updated all five chat mode files (backend-developer, business-analyst, mobile-developer, qa-engineer, and solutions-architect) to include log entry numbering in their logging protocols. Each chat mode now requires reading the existing log file to find the last entry number and incrementing it, or starting with "1" if the file is empty. The format was changed from "## Interaction [N]" to "## Log Entry: [N]" for consistency.
